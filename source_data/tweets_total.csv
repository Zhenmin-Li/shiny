Georgia,2020-05-13,Other scientists have tried to explain why the sense of smell suddenly vanishes But a new study now says that people lose their sense of smell in COVID 19 because of some changes in the brain Happens to be the only COVID 19 symptom that might help patients and doctors tell COVID 19 apart from the flu without a diagnostic test Doctors have been trained to recognize the sign and it s very likely they d recommend immediate COVID 19 testing if you re experiencing it Doctors have observed all sorts of unexpected symptoms during the first months of the COVID 19 pandemic with the sudden loss of smell anosmia and taste ageusia being the strangest ones Experts caution there s not enough evidence yet to draw a direct link between a SARS CoV 2 infection and hearing problems Other factors such as medications used to treat COVID 19 many of which are ototoxic or toxic to the ear could contribute to the complication The virus SARS CoV 2 has also been detected in the middle ear of COVID 19 patients as reported in JAMA Otolaryngology With several other viruses known to cause hearing loss the study s corresponding author C Matthew Stewart said the findings raise some concerns Several reports document patients who have experienced hearing problems that coincide with a COVID 19 diagnosis Often these issues which include tinnitus or ringing in the ears persist even after other symptoms of the illness subside Separate from the neurologic complications mentioned above some COVID 19 patients with no history of mental health issues have experienced mild to severe hallucinations More recent research published found that neurological manifestations headaches dizziness confusion etc were present in 42 percent of patients at the onset of COVID 19 symptoms and in 82 percent of patients at any time during the disease course In fact a study in JAMA Neurology found that more than 36 percent of 214 patients in Wuhan China experienced neurological symptoms during their bout of COVID 19 Loss of taste and smell which usually return after the virus runs its course are two symptoms on a growing list of neurological effects doctors are noting in COVID 19 patients Other indicators of the illness include dizziness headache and confusion In recent months a growing number of doctors have documented a handful of otherwise unexpected symptoms in patients with COVID 19 the illness caused by the coronavirus Some people who ve been treated for COVID 19 have presented with a strange phenomenon that clinicians have dubbed happy hypoxia Those people have had dangerously low levels of oxygen in their blood which would typically cause reduced consciousness Cardiovascular complications COVID 19 may raise the risk of abnormal blood clotting early reports suggest When clots form in small blood vessels in the feet or other extremities it can cause minor skin symptoms There are so many strange aspects to this virus Some people have presented with less typical symptoms including nausea diarrhea delirium chickenpox like lesions and more But in conditions like lupus some B cells never learn to do this and instead produce autoantibodies that glom onto DNA debris from dead human cells mistaking them for intruders Something similar may be happening in patients with Covid 19 the research suggests This misguided immune response may exacerbate severe Covid 19 It may also explain why so called long haulers have lingering problems months after their initial illness has resolved and the virus is gone from their bodies Coronavirus can significantly impact brain function causing mental decline equivalent to the brain aging 10 years according to an alarming new study A sample size surveyed in the UK found out that all the patients who were found to be COVID complained of serious coughing lasting for more than an hour or four or more violent coughing episodes in less than 24 hours Doctors have observed all sorts of unexpected symptoms during the first months of the COVID 19 pandemic with the sudden loss of smell anosmia and taste ageusia being the strangest ones As many as 40 percent of patients who are hospitalized because of a coronavirus infection die from blood clots including micro clots and the destruction they can cause heart attack stroke lung damage and the like And this catchall approach is what Dong expects will become the norm going forward especially as health care providers learn about the different ways a coronavirus infection can show up in the body Though most cases of COVID toes occur in the feet the hands can be affected too Rashes similar to those that result from hives and chicken pox have also been reported in people who test positive for the coronavirus she never would have predicted red and purple colored toes that swell burn and itch But that s exactly what she and other experts are seeing in patients with coronavirus infections leading this unusual symptom to be dubbed COVID toes These symptoms strange as they may seem reinforce what experts around the world have come to realize The coronavirus SARS CoV 2 is capable of causing more than a respiratory illness it can launch a full body attack In recent months a growing number of doctors have documented a handful of otherwise unexpected symptoms in patients with COVID 19 the illness caused by the coronavirus Some of the more sick people that we ve seen have had these kinds of severe cardiac manifestations of coronavirus and it s been very tough to manage Cioe Pena told Healthline They re digital nomads They re people of color Here s how they make it work Coronavirus can significantly impact brain function causing mental decline equivalent to the brain aging 10 years according to an alarming new study Doctors have observed all sorts of unexpected symptoms during the first months of the COVID 19 pandemic with the sudden loss of smell anosmia and taste ageusia being the strangest

California,2020-08-01,Gov Cuomo just this week stated even in New York the worst hit of all the states hospitals were not overwhelmed As a country United States has the resources and money to fight covid 19 We are at the first place in covid cases is because of Trump s ineffectiveness to do his job I blame trump for covid surge in the United States With the U S entering into the Third Wave of COVID 19 I wouldn t be surprised to see another lockdown or severe restrictions put in place in November yo This entire article is a telling window into delusional view that California s response to the COVID 19 pandemic has been a resounding success for Californians and public health Check out my latest COVID 19 blog on yo Get it here jason horrormovies horror creepy scary funny 2020 corona COVID 19 Madness The Party Shop No Donald If we don t get a handle on coronavirus we will have no recovery It really feels like you are doing your best to add to the suffering of the people that you swore to protect BlameTrump No it s not COVID a beta coronavirus Two of the endemic coronavirus that circulate annually are beta coronaviruses COVID is not that different genetically or Immunologically It may be the first coronavirus pandemic we have been aware of but coronaviruses are not new Donald You know how dangerous coronavirus is and you know the consequences The fact you are still having Super spreading rallies is down right evil At first I thought you were just stupid Then I thought Putin had something on you Now I think you might be the Antichrist Keep your mouth shut so you don t spread more coronavirus No Eric you Trumps are wrong Having these big rallies during a pandemic is evil Can t wait till you are in prison So mean I don t comment on Carl s Tweets for the same reason I don t comment Sridhars Feigel Ding s or similar minded scientists Bc their views on the pandemic are typically not based on anything I recognize as science I don t think it would lead to productive conversation Florida is doing ok The others will once their outbreaks end You can t wait out a pandemic It s not a storm We re not Asia The U S population are not going to overhaul their entire way of life to eradicate a now endemic virus that s mostly lethal to a small minority of elderly frail Individuals and unlikely to cause large mortality spikes once pandemic subsides No matter how much I m not sure I really know what is happening in China but even if they have permanently suppressed COVIF forever and will never allow it back into the country they are an outlier in the world Do you think science medicine and pandemic response should be based on an anomaly You knew the timeframe for Ebola No reason COVID should last longer than a flu pandemic With sustainable PH measures that support the vulnerable while enabling society 2 function it wouldn t be as worrying Sadly were 2 distracted failing at suppression 2 enact such a response Or perhaps overreacting and shutting down society is putting more people at risk than moving to a more rational pandemic response When society becomes fearful to the point it can no longer function that can be equally as dangerous as a pandemic Yep Not unique to COVID Other respiratory viruses cause these issues too They become more noticeable in a pandemic when there are higher of infections but respiratory viruses are nasty all the time I m not teaching online I ve worked in person in the lab amp taught in person throughout the pandemic I m not worried about catching COVID I m happy to contribute to immunity to help protect the vulnerable I had a nasty flu Feb that knocked me out for 2 months hopefully COVID face though it has dominated public health disproportionately You obviously think COVID response should dominate reshape societal function amp public health Not everyone agrees with you I see the same data I m not denying any aspect of the pandemic from the mortality spike to Yes Pandemics are scary You ve clearly adopted a worst case scenario opinion of every aspect of the pandemic There s nothing 2 stop u staying home waiting for a vaccine etc Not everyone shares your view Those who wish 2 resume their lives should be free 2 adopt that risk I get for Osterholm it must be exciting to finally have the pandemic he s been planning for all these years But for society real people with jobs bills and other personal health concerns life doesn t revolve around the control and elimination of one single disease I recognize long COVID I just don t think it s a reason to shut down the world or focus all efforts on this one disease COVID is not the only disease and pandemics are transient unlike many of the societal challenges that have been pushed aside in the pandemic response a vaccine either It will be the first never ending respiratory virus pandemic Let s see what happens I never denied COVID is killing people Quite the opposite I think the death toll is high amp we could have done better to protect the elderly with age targeted strategies Let s circle back in a year from now after we see how it plays out in real life What you are suggesting is that COVID is a virus so novel for which there can be no lasting immunity if this is true then the pandemic would essentially never end If that s true it won t end with No flu pandemic has ended with a vaccine only pandemic in history that never ends How are the gt 200 resp viruses that circulate annually controlled in the population in a permanent pandemic from endemic CoV Why not if the immunity cannot control the transmission of CoV in the population Do you think every person will lose immunity to COVID sequentially amp to the level needed to plunge us back into another pandemic Is COVID going to be the People haven t been accessing health care regardless of hospital capacity because they re too scared The quicker the pandemic comes to an end the quicker people can feel safe going the hospital again The vast majority of hospitals have had capacity for COVID amp regular patients Im sure COVID will be endemic after which high levels of mortality are Unlikely COVID has caused similar mortality levels to pandemic flu You can t compare pandemic mortality levels to endemic flu seasons through outbreaks amp move past the pandemic Suppressing the pandemic keeps the population susceptible to outbreaks and a never ending cycle of economically devastating closures and restrictions The economy is being hurt because of the business closures because we are dragging out the pandemic by slowing it down amp because society has been scared into a hermit like existence by misinformation amp irrational fear mongering The economy won t recover until states open go reduce as much as possible understanding we won t be able to save every life no matter what we do The world can t stop because we re experiencing a pandemic It s not the only societal or health concern No but we don t know how many people endemic CoV killed when they first emerged It could have been more than COVID You can not compare endemic flu seasons to a pandemic They are not comparable Pandemics are natural disasters that cause mortality spikes which we should try to many elderly people that could die if the pandemic is not mitigated properly infection but very likely reduces disease symptoms Any existing immunity is baked into the outcome of the pandemic which for the vast majority of the population is not severe That doesn t mean the vulnerable fraction is small amp should be ignored On the contrary there are No it s not COVID a beta coronavirus Two of the endemic coronavirus that circulate annually are beta coronaviruses COVID is not that different genetically or Immunologically It may be the first coronavirus pandemic we have been aware of but coronaviruses are not new This entire article is a telling window into delusional view that California s response to the COVID 19 pandemic has been a resounding success for Californians and public health Or if I was feeling creative discharge sick patients into nursing homes Never would I have dreamed of closing schools for 8 mths if the disease is NOT lethal 2 kids they play little role in spreading Isolate the lowest risk who play min role in the pandemic can t make it up They re completely ill equipped to handle the challenges of a pandemic It s quite staggering You can t make it up If someone had asked me to devise the worst pandemic response possible I would have said do nothing I understand that Hospital management is important for sure Hospitals will be busy and potentially stretched in a Pandemic like buildings will shake in an Earthquake I would personally feel better if the pandemic was brought to a safe conclusion with as few deaths as possible vs being artificially suppressed I m willing to live life potentially get COVID amp contribute to protective immunity that will stably control reduce outbreaks Seen numerous comments the population can t feel safe economy can t recover till COVID is controlled via NPI suppression Personally I m more afraid of constantly living on the precipice of an artificially suppressed pandemic that builds stealthily amp could explode any time,-0.010301383925544987,0.548793037685655

Texas,2020-08-15,Whether I believe all that or not is another conversation Here s the current numbers at Midland Memorial which seem quite high for our current situation here I do know they have received some patients from Lubbock Just wanted to share information I received two weeks ago from the President CEO of Midland Memorial Hospital in Midland TX His main comment It is extremely rare for us to identify a COVID 19 diagnosis in a patient who is being admitted for another reason Garrett Redfield mentioned the possibility not long ago It s definitely a possibility Garrett It s happening Garrett This is a very true statement CV is incentivized through the CARES Act Lol Man Eric Stop lying Quote The agency said that the risk of cold chain food circulating in China s market being contaminated by the novel coronavirus is very low Nowhere in that report had someone been infected Do you not have any integrity Seems mandatory to me man who had so far tested negative twice for coronavirus was in police custody and due to appear in court later in the day The science didn t change There are recent studies that proves exactly what he said in January Here he is in August contradicting himself later in September about t cell immunity Misinformation Different periods of time Science hasn t changed Fauci s agenda changed This is from August Even Redfield acknowledges the possibility Lol Potentially What horsecrap Eric 1 8 million kids in school in Sweden the entire pandemic No deaths NY seeing the same Nice try fear monger Garrett Redfield mentioned the possibility not long ago It s definitely a possibility Garrett It s happening Great article about Dr Eric Doom 19 She is completely materialistic and trying to fake a flex on Twitter while attending big parties during a pandemic I hope she doesn t kill anybody because she clearly doesn t gaf about others wellbeing But keep defending her That s because either you really do believe that it s still a pandemic and most of the population is at risk or you think we should believe it Truth is it s 99 survivable and that number is getting even better It s now a casedemic It should be debated There are no RCTs that prove efficacy of masks against CV RCTs for influenza provide mixed results There are WHO Influenza NPI pandemic guides that recommended against masking symptomless people It s not conclusive and deserves discussion Actually it does the opposite It gives people false security and they ignore distancing That s why the WHO Pandemic NPI guide recommended against healthy people using them lab There are zero randomized controlled trials RCT that prove the efficacy of masks against CV Studies against influenza are mixed Prior to CV they were never recommended for use by the entire population during a pandemic When you hear the words new normal you should be concerned There is nothing about what s going normal Things will return to normal as they have after other past pandemic epidemic events What does that even mean If everyone had protection that would mean they already have herd immunity Acquiring natural immunity is getting protection Your fear Tedros is no one will need the vaccine like back in 2009 when the WHO faked a pandemic I bet just like Vietnam and Thailand they stopped testing symptomless people and lowered the PCR ct 30 or less We could end the pandemic also by doing those two things 1 Lower PCR cycle threshold to 25 34 preferably below 30 2 Stop testing people with no symptoms 3 Symptomatic people stay home The pandemic would fade quickly Yea except the 1918 flu killed 50 million in 24 months CV has killed 1 2 million in almost 12 months in a population 7 times greater than that of 1918 Nowhere close to the 1918 pandemic We could end the pandemic in 14 days Lower the PCR ct to 24 30 stop testing those with no symptoms symptomatic people stay at home you know like we ve always done and pull Cares Act funding,0.08120167189132707,0.4424634273772204
